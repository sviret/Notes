\noindent Extracting track information is a two-stage process. First of all, you have to retrieve the hits belonging to the track: this is the pattern recognition. Then, you extract the track parameters (momentum, impact parameter,...) from the hits: this is the fit. Both steps are performed routinely in CMS, using very performant software algorithms. In order to pass to L1, tracking has to go hardware. Hardware-based tracking triggers were already developped in HEP experiments, in particular in the CDF experiment at Fermilab. Based on this system, the ATLAS experiment is planning to use a tracking trigger at the HLT after LHC long shutdown 2 in 2016. The working principle of these systems is sketched on Fig.~\ref{fig:L1TT_principle}. Tracker data is extracted by the FEDs and transmitted to the trigger board. Then, the data is handled by a data organization unit (DO), which extract the info necessary to the pattern recognition (PR), send it to the PR unit, and retrieve the matched patterns. The DO then sent the interesting hits to the track fit unit (TF), when the track parameters are estimated and sent to the L1 central trigger board.
\noindent In order to go at L1, one thus need the three following points: 

\begin{itemize}
\item A fast front-end readout system able to extract quickly all the data contained in the tracking detectors.
\item A system performing a fast pattern recognition.
\item A system performing a fast track fit.
\end{itemize}
